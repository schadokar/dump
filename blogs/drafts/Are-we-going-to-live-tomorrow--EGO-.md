This is the most important question which we rarely ask to ourselves. 

And i think this is the main root cause of all our EGO. We frequently fight for pride, self-respect, honour and what not. Are those fight worth to keep distance with our close one. We keep fight for our EGO but we never accept it. We hold on to grudges, hurt and ill-saying and above all, we think we known everything and we’re right and everything is others fault.

How can two people come close if one person in the end thinks I was stupid back then and other one is the worst person they ever met?

Everything once in a while hit the bad phase, even the rising sun also set. Will it make a sense that evening Sun just say I shouldn’t rise at all if I have to set, It was the worst rising…..

It’s just the time which makes sun set and the same time will make it rise again.

Are all these fights and distance matters if there is no tomorrow?
