Are we living in the 21st Century? Are we living in an Educated World, Civilized or Machine?   
I think we’re living in a ‘Yes’ World. Where everyone wants to be heard only ‘Yes’ for whatever they say, do or think. They don’t want to be challenged, rejected or hear ‘No’. That’s why today’s generation is so concerned about likes and thumbs up on social media.   
We feel miserable when someone disagrees with us. Questions start surfacing, How can I be wrong or Why he/she doesn’t agree, What’s the problem with him? and so on.  
We forgot the very basic things that we all have our own identity. We should accept the fact that others don’t have to agree with us they have their own opinion, their own beliefs.   
We all experience fight with our closed ones and with few of them we are not even in contact. We keep holding grudges and keeping our closed ones away because they didn’t act the way we were expecting.   
We must remember one thing  
“Anger is temporary, Ego is permanent”  
What did I mean by this?   
For instance: someone said you something which makes you go mad, you scream, abuse, cry, beat… what next? After all, this if you still don’t talk to that person, are you still angry? Nope, It’s our Ego!   
Which keeps remind us why we should be angry even when it’s not required.   
In the ‘Yes World’ just because of expecting ‘Yes’ we lost many friends, relationship and most importantly ourselves.  
 We shouldn’t have any expecting response before saying something. We should accept whatever comes agreement or disagreement, approval or rejection.
